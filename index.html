Labrador Retrievers

Introduction

Labrador Retrievers have consistently been one of the most popular
family pets both in the UK and elsewhere in the world for decades
thanks to trustworthy and proven natures. Labs are gentle, yet
outgoing and always eager to please which in short makes them highly
trainable. Being so intelligent, the Labrador Retriever thrives just
as well in a home environment as they do working alongside their
owners in the field.

Originally bred to retrieve nets for fishermen and then game and
fowl for hunters, the Labrador Retriever excels when asked to work
in difficult and challenging terrains. They are more especially
suited to work in and around water, thanks to their alertness and
excellent water-resistant coats. The Labrador Retriever loves taking
part in canine sports and they excel at other activities which
includes working as Guide and Assistant Dogs. For decades, the
Labrador Retriever has consistently been at the top of the list as a
preferred companion and family pet throughout the world.

History

The Labrador Retriever, as the name suggests, was originally bred
for a specific purpose which was to retrieve nets for fishermen and
the fact they have webbed paws makes them extremely strong and able
swimmers. The breed was later used to retrieve game when birds were
flushed out and shot by hunters which often took place in
challenging environments which included watery marshlands.

The breed originates from the coastal regions of Newfoundland and is
thought to have been created by crossing St John's Water Dogs with
other smaller breeds of water dogs and possibly Mastiffs, a breed
introduced to the country by Portuguese fishermen in the 16th and
17th centuries. The St John's Water dog is also an ancestor of the
Newfoundland, a dog that is closely related to the Labrador with the
Lab being the smaller of the two dogs and having shorter coats
whereas the Newfoundland is the larger dog and one that was used to
haul carts back in the day.

Labradors were first introduced into the UK in the late 1800's by
the Earl of Malmsbury and Col Peter Hawker. Both men developed a
keen interest in the breed and arranged for a selection of dogs to
be imported to the UK. Many Chocolate Labradors are decendants of a
Labrador Retriever called Buccleuch Avon, a dog that was gifted to
the Duke of Buccleuch in Scotland in 1890 by the Duke of Malmsbury.
Another dog called Malmesbury Tramp owned by Countess Howe, is among
the main ancestors of the modern Labrador Retrievers we see today.

Breed numbers fell in Newfoundland for a combination of reasons, but
thanks to the efforts of the first and second Earls of Malmesbury
who, through their careful breeding programmes, continued to develop
and improve the breed in the UK where they were to become some of
the most highly prized as gundogs in the field.

Interesting facts about the breed

Are Labrador Retrievers a vulnerable breed? No, they are among the
most popular both in the UK and in other countries of the world

There is some thought that Labrador Retrievers might have been
called St. John's dogs or they may have been called Lesser
Newfoundlands. Other people think the breed was named after the
Portuguese word "lavradores" or the Spanish word "labradores"
which when translated means rural/agricultural workers. There is a
village in Portugal called Castro Laboreiro where herding dogs are
very similar looking to Labrador Retrievers too

Liver and golden Labs were known to exist way back in 1807 when
they were referred to a chocolate or butterscotch-yellow coloured
dogs

The first yellow Labrador to have been recognised was a dog named
Ben of Hyde

Chocolate Labs became popular in the thirties

Gold and fox red Labradors were bred to reestablish the colours by
breeders in England using Balrion King Frost and his grandson
Wynfaul Tabasco, a dog responsible for being the biggest influence
in re-establishing the colour fox red in the breed

All chocolate Labradors can trace their origins to eight
bloodlines
