        <h1>Labrador Retrievers</h1>
        <section>
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Labrador Retrievers have consistently been one of the most popular
            family pets both in the UK and elsewhere in the world for decades
            thanks to trustworthy and proven natures. Labs are gentle, yet
            outgoing and always eager to please which in short makes them highly
            trainable. Being so intelligent, the Labrador Retriever thrives just
            as well in a home environment as they do working alongside their
            owners in the field.
          </p>

          <p>
            Originally bred to retrieve nets for fishermen and then game and
            fowl for hunters, the Labrador Retriever excels when asked to work
            in difficult and challenging terrains. They are more especially
            suited to work in and around water, thanks to their alertness and
            excellent water-resistant coats. The Labrador Retriever loves taking
            part in canine sports and they excel at other activities which
            includes working as Guide and Assistant Dogs. For decades, the
            Labrador Retriever has consistently been at the top of the list as a
            preferred companion and family pet throughout the world.

          <h2>Interesting facts about the breed</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Are Labrador Retrievers a vulnerable breed? No, they are among the
              most popular both in the UK and in other countries of the world
            </li>
            <li>
              There is some thought that Labrador Retrievers might have been
              called St. John's dogs or they may have been called Lesser
              Newfoundlands. Other people think the breed was named after the
              Portuguese word "lavradores" or the Spanish word "labradores"
              which when translated means rural/agricultural workers. There is a
              village in Portugal called Castro Laboreiro where herding dogs are
              very similar looking to Labrador Retrievers too
            </li>
            <li>
              Liver and golden Labs were known to exist way back in 1807 when
              they were referred to a chocolate or butterscotch-yellow coloured
              dogs
            </li>
            <li>
              The first yellow Labrador to have been recognised was a dog named
              Ben of Hyde
            </li>
            <li>
              Chocolate Labs became popular in the thirties
            </li>
            <li>
              Gold and fox red Labradors were bred to reestablish the colours by
              breeders in England using Balrion King Frost and his grandson
              Wynfaul Tabasco, a dog responsible for being the biggest influence
              in re-establishing the colour fox red in the breed
            </li>
            <li>
              All chocolate Labradors can trace their origins to eight
              bloodlines
            </li>
