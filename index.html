Labrador Retrievers

Introduction

Labrador Retrievers have consistently been one of the most popular
family pets both in the UK and elsewhere in the world for decades
thanks to trustworthy and proven natures. Labs are gentle, yet
outgoing and always eager to please which in short makes them highly
trainable. Being so intelligent, the Labrador Retriever thrives just
as well in a home environment as they do working alongside their
owners in the field.
Originally bred to retrieve nets for fishermen and then game and
fowl for hunters, the Labrador Retriever excels when asked to work
in difficult and challenging terrains. They are more especially
suited to work in and around water, thanks to their alertness and
excellent water-resistant coats. The Labrador Retriever loves taking
part in canine sports and they excel at other activities which
includes working as Guide and Assistant Dogs. For decades, the
Labrador Retriever has consistently been at the top of the list as a
preferred companion and family pet throughout the world.
